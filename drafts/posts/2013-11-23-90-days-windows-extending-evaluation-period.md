Searched a lot for this, but eventually [Microsoft][1] gave me the answer: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/948472

1. Click Start, and then click Command Prompt.
  
2. Type slmgr.vbs -dli, and then press ENTER to check the current status of your evaluation period.
  
3. To reset the evaluation period, type slmgr.vbs â€“rearm, and then press ENTER.
  
4. Restart the computer.
