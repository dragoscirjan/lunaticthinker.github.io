I wish I had the key to every opening!
  
I wish the stars would reach to me for every need!
  
The sand would then become my slave
  
Build castles in the blistering wind,
  
raise mountains from the troubled sea
  
and slowly reach the dreams within
  
and slowly earn &#8230;
  
and than would you be safe? would&#8230;
  
I be safe? would we?
