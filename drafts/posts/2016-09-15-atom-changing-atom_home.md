How many of you didn&#8217;t try to make a propert IDE from [Atom][1] by now. Let me tell you. From many many many many (I forgot how many) points of view, it&#8217;s one of the best **text editors** out there. And yes, with a little work, the right plugins and a lot of think through, it can be transformed into a proper IDE.

Not what I&#8217;m gonna talk abut today though&#8230; Gonna talk about a bugging issue, that always bothererd me because (at least in it&#8217;s early days (and I mean versions 1.5 to 1.8)) I experienced it A LOT. While not on SSD, but on **old good and latent HDD**, if Atom had a lot of plugins installed (let&#8217;s be serious, **npm** doesn&#8217;t do a great job with package management and neither does **apm**), from time to time, Atom was crashing. It was refusing to load properly, couldn&#8217;t index either the project nor the plugin list and had to [reset it (read here how)][2]. Not saying it was Atom&#8217;s fault. I had like at least 100 plugins installed. Any of those could be the black sheep. But remember, I had Atom installed on both Win and Linux on SSDs drives, and never ever ever had this problem.

So I began a new quest (please keep in mind I&#8217;m just an Atom user, not a developer). A quest to find out whether I could change the home path for Atom. I asked again for an SSD (only a multinational company manager could ignore our requests for SSDs in a time of upgrade and buy us HDDs because they&#8217;re plain cheaper), after proving my point that the HDD is TOO SLOW to load my tools, and finally got one, but couldn&#8217;t reinstall OS. SO I had to, somehow, move my Atom home folder to another partition. So here it is (for Windows, obviously, but you could adapt it to any OS, I guess):

**[the .bat version][3]**

<pre>. $HOME/bin/path.sh

set ATOM_HOME=F:\path\to\new_atom_home\.atom
start C:\path\to\atom\Update.exe --processStart atom.exe
echo ATOM_HOME currently at %ATOM_HOME%
echo.
pause
</pre>

**[the .sh version][4]** in case you&#8217;re using git bash

<pre>#! /bin/bash

export ATOM_HOME="/path/to/new_atom_home/.atom" && /c/path/to/atom/Update.exe --processStart atom.exe
echo ATOM_HOME currently at $ATOM_HOME
</pre>

**Note:** If you wish to use the .sh version, your atom shortcut exec path should look like:

<pre>C:\path\to\git\git-bash.exe C:\path\to\atom.sh
</pre>

**Note:** If you wish to download my scripts, feel free to, but don&#8217;t forget to adapt it to your own paths.
