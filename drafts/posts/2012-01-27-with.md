If I could only show you
  
how fascinating roses are
  
when looking to your eyes

there is no shape of clay
  
I&#8217;m but an ordinary being
  
not knowing truly what to say
  
Yet knowing what he wishes for

there&#8217;s nothing but a dream to share<!--more-->


  
the wonder&#8230; the eternity of a second
  
near you
  
with
  
you
