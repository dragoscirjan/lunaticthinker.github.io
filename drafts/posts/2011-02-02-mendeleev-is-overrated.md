Dudes, I&#8217;ve just discovered that Mendeleev&#8217;s periodical table is totally overrated! Yes&#8230; a new periodical table has been discovered!

Behold! <a href="http://code.google.com/more/table/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOOGLE&#8217;s PERIODICAL TABLE</a>!

Now&#8230; leaving the jokes behind, the idea is very good. +1 point to Google for thinking out smart. It&#8217;s very easy now, to discover their APIs without too much trouble.
