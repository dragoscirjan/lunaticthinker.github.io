l know I&#8217;ve told you that for this next poem
  
l&#8217;m waiting for the right music;
  
Well&#8230; I haven&#8217;t found it.Â It seems l am unable
  
To feel other music than the one you
  
Somehow manage to feed me

No matter how far you are&#8230;

l wonder&#8230; If I&#8217;ll try to steall from you
  
This precious gift I crave so much for<!--more-->


  
l wonder&#8230; Will l ever have the courage
  
To try and touch your lips

A dream of the fools&#8230;

I&#8217;m afraid of falling&#8230; I think;
  
And in your own way so are you!
  
But somehow I feel I already fell
  
And thus I search for&#8230; a way to tell
  
But I fear&#8230; I fear no magic has ever
  
been born without a price&#8230;

Yet _I am happy to pay!_
